      <h2>Map Overview</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          View 1: The Yunnan Region of China. The Yunnan Province is a
          mountainous region in Southwestern China. The Province borders
          Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos.
        </li>
        <li>
          View 2: Yunnan's Plateau Region. The region is home to many lakes,
          comprising a total surface area of 1,066 km<sup>2</sup>. Nine of these
          "plateau" lakes are recognized as having surface areas over 30
          km<sup>2</sup>. The lakes span multiple watersheds. Fuxian Lake,
          Xingyun Lake, and Qilu Lake are all in the same watershed.
        </li>
        <li>
          View 3: The Yuxi City District. Three of these "plateau lakes"
          (Fuxian, Xingyun, and Qilu Lakes) fall entirely within the Yuxi City
          District of Yunnan. The Yuxi City government is responsible for the
          restoration and protection of these lakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          View 4: Three Yuxi Lakes. Of these three lakes, Fuxian is
          substantially larger and deeper than Qilu or Xingyun. From a satellite
          image, Qilu and Xingyun appear green while Fuxian is dark blue due to
          being deeper and cleaner.
        </li>
        <li>
          View 5: Comparing lakes of the Yuxi with Lake Erie. Lake Erie faces
          similar threats to water quality despite its larger volume and surface
          area. Lake Erie is perhaps 100 times bigger than the other lakes,
          although Fuxian lake is deeper on average than Lake Erie.
